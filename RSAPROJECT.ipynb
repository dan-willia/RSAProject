    "Welcome to my RSA project. RSA is an encryption scheme that allows secure transfer of information where neither party needs to exchange a \"secret\" key. To understand the significance of this, consider one approach to sending an encoded message. You want to send a super secret message to your friend, so you encode your message with a super strong encoding algorithm. You send it to your friend. Your friend writes back a message saying, \"Thanks for the message, but how do I decode it?\" You now have to find a way to communicate to them the \"key\" to decoding the message. But how can you send them the key securely? If you encrypt the key, we need another key to decrypt it, and so on and so on. This highlights an issue with \"secret\" key schemes: you need to have a way of securely exchanging keys. This is the \"private key\" apporach. RSA uses a \"public key\" approach, which does not rely on the secure transfer of private keys. Rather, both recipient and receiver (and everyone else in the network) have two pairs of keys, a public pair, which everyone knows, and a private pair, which only the owner knows. If you wish to send a message to receipient A, you use their public key to encode a message. This encoding can only be broken by recipient A's private key. Hence, no secret keys are exchanged. The beauty of RSA lies in the fact that there are relatively simple algorithms that can produce such pairs of numbers that satisfy the requirements for being public and private keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "This program implements the basic RSA scheme. In addition, I added a custom feature which is an interactive command line program that expands on the basic encoding and decoding of messages. In this program, you choose to generate n-digit keys (though don't go above 7), encrypt and decrypt .txt files, attempt to break keys, as well as encode and decode messages."

    "My process for this project was relatively linear. This Jupyter notebook broke down the functions needed for RSA and provided all the necessary documentation to proceed in the coding in a straightforward way. However, in order to understand how all the pieces fit together, I had to go back and watch Prof. Ketelsen's lectures on RSA encryption. I took careful notes during the video to make sure I understood everything. Specifically, the slides about the assumptions in RSA, where the relationships between p, q, n, e, and d, were explained was very helpful in later writing the code. It was also just interesting to see so many different ideas that we had been working with come together -- it was pretty mind blowing to see the Chinese Remainder Theorem tie everything together at the end. This big picture understanding helped me come up with ideas for the custom feature. I learned that, although it is possible to code without understanding the bigger picture, it is much more enjoyable to code when you understand the bigger picture, and it is probably more efficient, since you are thinking about how your function fits in with other functions and you will design it so that it does this well. \n",
    "\n",
    "On to the coding part. Siriam's algorithms for FME, EA, and EEA were essential, and saved countless hours. The time I spent the most on were the Find_Keys functions. The first time I coded ```Find_Public_Key_e``` I just used the lowest possible ```e``` I could find. I knew at the time I would change this, but I was focused on getting the whole thing to run. This was a non-essential feature I could add later. After I had the whole thing running, it seemed better to choose testing randomly chosen possible e's so that different ```e```'s could be generated from the same ```(p, q)```. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ```Find_Private_Key_d```, ```d``` is the second Bézout coefficient of gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1)), which is calculated using EEA. When I was testing, I discovered that sometimes it returned a negative value. To fix this, I added a ```while``` loop to flip its sign. Understanding modular inverses was essential to understanding why we need the Bezout coefficients. I spent a lot of time in the book/watching the lecture videos understanding modular arithmetic, and I felt like it paid off in this function, which, though only a few lines, really required an understanding of RSA and modular inverses to get right. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ```Encode``` and ```Decode```, the first time I coded it I forgot to use FME, so it was just using Python's %. I didn't notice it on my tests because I was using fairly small numbers, but I did catch it when looking through my functions a second time. Another issue I kept running into was the types of the input and outputs. I learned the value of good commenting and later I discovered type annotations which I found essential to keeping everything readable. I also appreciated the ability to hover over functions to peak at their type annotations/comments in VS Code. \n",
    "\n",
    "On to exchanging codes. It definitely didn't work the first time. For example, I mistakenly called Encode with the private key instead of the public key. That was \"user error\" and not a mistake with my code, however. Thankfully, I found that no major changes needed to be made. It was a feeling of great relief when it worked the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging part of the assignment was the custom feature. Because it is my own thing, I spent much more time with it. I'll talk more about that in the custom feature section. For this beginning part, the most challenging part was just understanding all the pieces and how they fit together. After that, the project was helpfully structured in a way where I could proceed from function to function in a pretty linear manner. But again, actually understanding what was going on required more effort than the actual coding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Resources: I believe I used only class resources for this first part. The lecture video on RSA was very helpful in understanding the big picture. Siriam's lectures on the algorithms -- also the proofs! -- were very interesting and of course his going through some of the essential functions for us saved a lot of time. I consulted Rosen a few times at the beginning, but later felt that the other resources provided were more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think my \"best\" mistake was that I wished I did more work on testing how fast my functions were running. I guess in this project I was more focused on getting the coding done and understanding how the pieces fit together. I wish I had spent more time measuring the speed of some of the functions. Since this is my first semester in the program and I don't come from an engineering background, the focus on speed/efficiency is something I'm still getting used to, and I should focus more on measuring such things in the future. On similar lines, I believe I could have finished this project sooner if I had shown more fortitude. In the future, I'd like to complete assignments with more of a buffer before the deadline."

    "### Custom Feature Narrative \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 options in my custom module. We'll start with option 5, which generates keys. The technical problem of generating keys comes down to generating prime numbers. To do this, I implemented the Miller-Rabin primality test. I chose to implement this algorithm because it is widely-used and is not obvious how it works. The test is actually a test of compositeness -- it can only tell us with certainty if a number is composite, and that a number is otherwise \"probably prime\". To reduce the chances of a false positive, I run the test 40 when finding primes. If the number fails to trigger a \"composite\" return, then we can be very sure that it is prime. To test the function, I also implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is the generate_primes(n) function. This function generates all primes up to n. Below, I use it to generate primes up to 10000, and show that there is 100% agreement between it and the miller_rabin_test:"

    "Besides the inherent interest in implementing the Miller-Rabin test, it is also a better way to generate primes within a certain range, which is the functionality I required. To do so with the Sieve of Eratosthenes, you have to first generate all the primes up to the upper bound of your range, and then choose a prime from within that range, which means you've done a good deal of wasted computation finding the primes below the lower bound. For primes of more than several digits this takes far too long to be useable. In my function generate_n_dig_keys(n), I determine the range of numbers I want to search between first, and then randomly test numbers in this range, stopping after I have found two suitable primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we generate our keys, we can use them to encrypt messages using option 1. The only improvement I made here was to convert each encoded character from an int to a string, and to prepend 0's so that each digit-string is the same size. This was necessary because I wanted to be able to concatenate the blocks together into one long string. If the length of the blocks varies, there is a parsing problem: the decode function can't know ahead of time which blocks are potentially smaller than the others. While this doesn't actually solve the frequency analysis problem, having one long string of digits at least *looks* harder to crack. Block sizes are determined by the size of n, so that the decode function calculates the same block size as the encode function. \n",

    "\n",
    "Options 3 and 4 involve encrypting and decypting files. This follows essentially the same pattern as encrypting and decypting messages, except we are reading files. The file reader reads in blocks of strings from the file. Each block is encoded/decoded and appended to a list. This scheme means that whatever the size limit of a list is in python will be the limit of the size of the file that can be encrypted or decrypted.\n",

    "    - input validation:  takes a lot of time to code. I came up with my own way of  doing it, but I wish I knew about pyinputplus BEFORE starting this. Also, I didn't use try / excepts which I gather is the usual way of doing this. In general, I feel like I don't use try/excepts as much I should. \n",
    "    - type annotations: extremely useful for this project, especially because of all the conversions between ints, strs, and lists of strs/ints. \n",
    "    - the Python style guide: I didn't read the whole thing but I did read substantial parts, especially related to commenting and type annotations. I reformatted all my functions to (hopefully) conform to the style guide, at least in these respects. \n",
    "    - unit testing: while I am good at testing my functions as I go, I want to get better at systematically testing and storing my tests in separate files. I did find myself rewriting tests a lot even though I know this is not best practice. I recently learned about pytest, and plan to use this in future. \n",
    "    - priorities: in the end I feel I could've/should've done more with writing/understanding algorithms and testing the speed of things. I'm not sure that I really added much to the original project. Part of what I learned in this was what I should be focusing on as I progress through this program -- writing a cute CL program is nice, but I think my time would have been better spent focusing more on the computer science and math part of things, since that is what this degree is about. I think I missed the opportunity to dive deeper, and for that reason I give myself a 7/10. "
